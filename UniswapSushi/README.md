# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## System dependencies

Main realization: when copying over projects. You will get dependency conflicts unless you start with a blank slate and do the following things first

### 1. 

`yarn add --dev hardhat`

### 2. 

`npx hardhat`, after which you'll see the hardhat insignia

```
$ npx hardhat
